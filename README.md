This dice was created with Python and Qiskit<br>
Special thanks to Mehmet Arda Yıldırım!<br>

# Why use a quantum dice
Because it is cooler <br>
Also methods to create randomness that are based on classical physics are not truly random<br>
If you could know every parameter affecting the "random" output, you could calculate the not so random output<br>
Quantum sytems on the other hand are truly random<br>
# How it works
A quantum circuit consisting of 3 qubits and 3 classical bits is created<br>
Hadamard gates are applied to these qubits, putting them in a superposition of 0 and 1<br>
The qubits are measured and as a result, these qubits take the values 0 or 1 randomly<br>
These values are stored in the classical bits<br><br>
The quantum circuit is executed in IBM's quantum computers<br>
